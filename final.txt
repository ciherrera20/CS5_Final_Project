| Description |
---------------
This game is a minecraft-style building game in which the player starts on an island in the sky, collects resources, 
and traverses an obstacle course to get to a goal on another island. The player is able to break blocks to collect 
building materials which will make it easier to get to the goal. Alternatively, they could choose to not spend time 
collecting resources and risk falling and dying by jumping through the obstacle course. When the player breaks a block, 
it goes straight into their inventory, meaning it can be placed later. The player's inventory has 9 slots, and only 
one type of block can be in any slot at a given time.
