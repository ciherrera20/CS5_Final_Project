| Description |
---------------
This game is a minecraft-style building game in which the player starts on an island in the sky, collects resources, 
and traverses an obstacle course to get to a goal on another island. The player is able to break blocks to collect 
building materials which will make it easier to get to the goal. Alternatively, they could choose to not spend time 
collecting resources and risk falling and dying by jumping through the obstacle course. When the player breaks a block, 
it goes straight into their inventory, meaning it can be placed later. The player's inventory has 9 slots, and only 
one type of block can be in any slot at a given time.

--------
| Tips |
--------
* Use a mouse
* Its easier to break and place blocks in first person mode
* The green moving obstacles only have collision detection on the sides, so you can jump into them to avoid them
* Letting water and lava flow into each other makes infinite cobblestone

--------------
| Collisions |
--------------
* Linear Collision
    Linear collision detection and resolution between axis aligned bounding boxes.

* Point Collision
    Point collision detection between rays and axis aligned bounding boxes for the simple ray tracing algorithm used to 
    detect which block the player is looking at.

* Linear Collision Detection and Spherical Collision Resolution
    Used for the moving obstacles in the game/obstacle course.
