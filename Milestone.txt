Members: Olivia Yin and Chris Herrera

Note: We have two separate programs right now but we are talking with each other and plan
on merging over the weekend
The controls are all over the place right now but my program has several functions

Controls:
up/down/left/right = controlling the player as well as the hitbox that surrounds the player
I/J/K/L = controlling the small box within the hitbox to select objects to mine

W/S = controls the height of the player and hitbox (will not be here later)
O/N = controls the height of the small box within the hitbox

P = places water
L = places lava

Function 1: Mining/Building a Cobblestone generator

Click "M" when you have the small box near the player covering a block of choice (of the island)
- that should mine the block and make it disappear

How to build a cobblestone generator: (if the directions are confusing the internet helps: "Minecraft cobblestone generator")
1. Mine 4 blocks in a straight line (preferably with blocks surrounding all sides)
2. On the 3rd block of the 4 block line, dig down one more
3. Place water using the 'P' on the longer side of the 4 block line
4. Place lava on the leftover block

*There are some bugs here where it works for one way more than the other (will fix)
Suggestion: place the water on the side further away from the tree and let it flow towards the tree


Objective: Get to a second island
We have some maps already ready but we are still trying to get everything together
Our goal is to use mining and placing blocks to get through an obstacle course and 
make it to a second island other than the one that was already made. 

Things to work on (individually):
- Fix water problem
- Fix player origin to NOT a constant (wanted an animation of the player walking)
- Get player hitbox working and visible

FRIDAY/WEEKEND:
- Merging and getting everything working
